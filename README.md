=========

Overview: Computer music improvisation final year project, jazz/blues improvisation on top of 12 bar blues.
The project is currently under development and is an academic research project so is intended to be used as a commercial tool.

Usage: The program takes as a first argument in a text file with a musical grammar (see 'bluesgrammar.txt') for an example and 
the second argument takes a path which points to the Jython installation folder on the machine.
The program also uses Jython (a Java implementation of Python) to do grammar parsing and sentence generation. 
Jython version 2.5.3 is used here in addition to the pyparsing library (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) version 1.5.7.
